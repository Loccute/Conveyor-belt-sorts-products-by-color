# Conveyor-belt-sorts-products-by-color
This is a project that uses conveyor belts to classify products by color. We differentiate between 4 types of colors including: red, green, blue and other colors. At the same time, count the number of products of each color type.

The product classification process includes the following steps:

	Step 1: We start the engine to let the conveyor belt run.
  
	Step 2: Place objects on the running conveyor belt.
  
	Step 3: Objects run across the color sensor to recognize which color they are. At the same time, below the conveyor belt there are boxes to store objects of the same color. When you reach the correct position in    the box of any color, there will be a lever to push that object down.
  
	Step 4: Obstacle sensors are mounted above the boxes to count the number of products of each color.

We have an image of the project as follows

We use embedded software written in Arduino language in this project. Link demo project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OT8RTkoRJAJAPopeO4nxeGmVUK2RfYer/view?usp=sharing
